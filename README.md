Sharing your opinon, talking about animation, characters and story

The picture is the most important of the page i would say.
It really draws you attetnion into it. It's very colourful and you see a glimps of how the charcaters look like in diffrent anime serie.
These characters are some of my favourit and that's because how they see life itself and how they get thoru it from smiles to sadnees, from kindness to rage , from beliving 
in humaniti to wanting to destory the world.
Watching throu some of the animes you get to learn some of the real world as well. For exempel that life is not easy, every person has a problem that you are not aware of,
kindness is taking as weakness, harsh reality of how some people behave and how some change etc.

One thing that hits hard, speaking as an anime watcher myself, they have alot of amazing and inspiring quotes.
Quotes that can be motivation or a reailty check. My personal favourit quote is from Naruto Shipudden from a charachtera Madara Uchiha and the quote goes as follows:
- “We need guidance to help us find a purpose in life. Without this, life will be just a journey without any real destination.”
For me that's a really powerful quote.

On the pictures you can see some powerful qutoes that are said in the anime series. If you read those qutoes they have some things in commen.
The commen thing is that without trying and starting to hesitate you won't get far, if you are doing something you don't like change it and do something you enjoy
