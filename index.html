        <p class="anime-story">
            Anime usually comes in three formats: <br>
            TV series: Each episode is about 24 minutes long, there are 12-13 episodes per quarter, and each series must span an integer number of quarters. 
            Anything longer than 2 quarters is considered "long running" or "mainstream crap".<br>
            OVAs: are released directly on cassettes, floppy discs or other carrier media that are in vogue at the time. Since they do not have to worry about TV censorship, many OVAs are unusually sexy or gory. <br>
            Especially many TV series have OVAs that consist mainly of fanservice, and all hentai are released as OVAs.
            OVAs are usually 1-6 episodes long, with each episode being about 30 minutes long. <br>
            Movies 1-2 hours long, like a live action movie. <br>
            Compared to TV, anime movies usually look prettier and are more action-packed. <br>
            Hayao Miyazaki is famous for his anime films like <strong>Spirited Away</strong>, and recently <i>Makoto Shinkai</i> has also found success with anime films like <strong>Your Name</strong>.
            <br>
            A sufficiently popular anime can encompass all three formats, with a couple of seasons of the series TV, a fanservice OVA and a film as the grand finale. <br>
            In terms of content, "anime" is about as meaningless as "TV " - it can be anything from situation comedy to crime thriller to action.</p>
            
            <h2 class="div-h2">Where/How to start watching anime</h2>
            <p class="anime-story">
                First you need an account at <b>Crunchyroll</b>, you also have <i>(Amazon Anime, Directv, Anime Planet Tubi Tv)</i> but i recommend Crunchyroll because it has
                all the anime you need, sign up with a premium membership. With a premium membership you get <b>14</b> days free with unlimited anime shows and manga!
                Crunchyroll a free webbsite but you only have acces to some anime and you need to watch commircles during an episode.
                With premium you can avoid all of that with a monthly subscripcion of only 6,6£ get unlimited anime, manga and no commercials!<br>

                The first i would recommend is whatch an anime that's not long by that i mean not many episodes. <b>Attack on Titan</b> is on of those animes. 
                You follow the protaganist <i>Eren Yeager</i> who tries to fight his way of freedom by making hard choices and figthing until the end. Others i recommend are 
                <b>Fireforce</b> and <b>Jujutsu Kaisen</b>. <b>Fireforce</b> is about a person named <i>Shinra Kusakabe</i> who wants to find out the truth about an incident that happened his family.
                <b>Jujutsu Kaisen</b> follows <i>Yuji Itadori</i> who learns to 2 powerful messages from his grandfarther "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." 
                While learning those messages you get to see <i>Yuji Itadori</i> live through those meanings!
