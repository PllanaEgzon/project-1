        <p class="how-to-start">
            Anime usually comes in three formats: <br>
            TV series: Each episode is about 24 minutes long, there are 12-13 episodes per quarter, and each series must span an integer number of quarters. 
            Anything longer than 2 quarters is considered "long running" or "mainstream crap".<br>
            Especially many TV series have OVAs that consist mainly of fanservice, and all hentai are released as OVAs.
            OVAs are usually 1-6 episodes long, with each episode being about 30 minutes long. <br>
            Movies 1-2 hours long, like a live action movie. <br>
            Compared to TV, anime movies usually look prettier and are more action-packed. <br>
            
            
            <h2 class="facts-suggestion-2">Where/How to start watching anime</h2>
            <p class="how-to-start">
                First you need an account at <b>Crunchyroll</b>, you also have <i>(Amazon Anime, Directv, Anime Planet Tubi Tv)</i> but i recommend Crunchyroll because it has
                all the anime you need, sign up with a premium membership. With a premium membership you get <b>14</b> days free with unlimited anime shows and manga!
                Crunchyroll a free webbsite but you only have acces to some anime and you need to watch commircles during an episode.
                With premium you can avoid all of that with a monthly subscripcion of only 6,6£ get unlimited anime, manga and no commercials!<br>
                The first i would recommend is whatch an anime that's not long by that i mean not many episodes. <b>Attack on Titan</b> is on of those animes. 
                You follow the protaganist <i>Eren Yeager</i> who tries to fight his way of freedom by making hard choices and figthing until the end.
